JRaaS stands for Job Recommendation as a Service. It aims at easing the HR personnel efforts by helping them find the right candidate through a bank of resumes using Data mining concepts. 

The application is built entirely using Node.js, Javascript, jQuery and Jade templates.

*Lots of scope to improve the recommendation.*
